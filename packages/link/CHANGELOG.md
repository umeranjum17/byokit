SECURITY: Node hostKeyFile/device store wrote the device secret through a predictable temp path that followed symlinks; now a random O_EXCL 0600 temp file

- React Native `secureDeviceStore` keeps device grants in platform secure storage.
- Browser `browserDeviceStore` seals grants in IndexedDB, orders saves with clears across tabs when Web Locks are available, and blocks saves of the last forgotten device ID.
- Node/Electron `fileDeviceStore` persists grants in a private file, optionally sealed by Electron safeStorage.
