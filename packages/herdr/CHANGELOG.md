# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Scaffold (docs/runtime-kits.md §11.3 H1): frozen public types, kit facade, internal seams and words. Behavior
  lands in H2–H8; `HERDR_PROTOCOL` is a placeholder until the schema snapshot (H2).
- Wire `HerdrKit.cli`/`terminal` to `runCli`/`openTerminal` with the supervisor env (6.5), export
  `./testing`, and run `herdrContract` against `startFakeHerdr` in `test/contract.test.ts`.
